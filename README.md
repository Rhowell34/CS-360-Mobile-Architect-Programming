**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The goal of this project was to create an Inventory tracking application. It must have a user login with passwords and a valid email address. This ensures that only the correct user can commit changes to the inventory that is stored. After the user has logged in, they can create, read, update, and delete data that is stored in the application. When the inventory count of a specific item gets low, and the user has opted in to SMS messages, the user will receive a notification that that specific inventory item count is low.  

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

There were a few screens that were necessary to support the user needs of this application. The screens necessary will be the login screen, the main screen that shows the inventory list, the help screen, the add data screen, update data screen, and the allow SMS messages screen. These screens combined will deliver the required functionality to the end user of the inventory application. The UI I designed for this application was very simple. I did not want to make the UI to complicated to ensure that the app was very easy and intuitive to use. I do believe that these design elements were successful in the final product.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**
