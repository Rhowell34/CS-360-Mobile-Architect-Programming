**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**
The goal of this project was to create an Inventory tracking application. It must have a user login with passwords and a valid email address. This ensures that only the correct user can commit chnages to the inventory that is stored. After the user has been logging in they can create, read, update, and delete data that is stored in the application. When the inventory count of a specific item gets low, and the user has opted in to SMS messages, the user will recieve a notification that that specific inventory item count is low.  
**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
