**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The goal of this project was to create an Inventory tracking application. It must have a user login with passwords and a valid email address. This ensures that only the correct user can commit changes to the inventory that is stored. After the user has logged in, they can create, read, update, and delete data that is stored in the application. When the inventory count of a specific item gets low, and the user has opted in to SMS messages, the user will receive a notification that that specific inventory item count is low.  

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

There were a few screens that were necessary to support the user needs of this application. The screens necessary will be the login screen, the main screen that shows the inventory list, the help screen, the add data screen, update data screen, and the allow SMS messages screen. These screens combined will deliver the required functionality to the end user of the inventory application. The UI I designed for this application was very simple. I did not want to make the UI to complicated to ensure that the app was very easy and intuitive to use. I do believe that these design elements were successful in the final product.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

The way I approached the design of application was the same as the structure of the course. This was my first time creating an application, so I followed the guidelines of the class exactly. This first step was creating the UI for each page that I had planned for the application. I ensured that each page of the UI was intuitive for the user to use and not overly complicated. This was a very important step for me because this was the first app that I have developed. Keeping the Ui simple ensured the user would be able to use it very easily and that I would be able to achieve the intended functionality. Once I was satisfied with the development of the UI I then began to work on the business logic for each screen. This started with a simple UML diagram I drew and then moved to full development. I started with the functionality login page and moved progressively from there until the overall app was complete. This may not be the best way to develop an application, but it did work for me. I completed each pageâ€™s business logic and then tested it using the virtual device provided within Android studios. This exact process could be applied to any project I start in the future in other courses or work environments.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

I tested the application on multiple different virtual machines withing the Android studio environment. I also tested functionality of requirements individually as I developed it to ensure that each user requirement worked and preformed as intended. I spent quite a bit of time testing each user need to try and find any bugs. This was the amin method of testing I employed.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
